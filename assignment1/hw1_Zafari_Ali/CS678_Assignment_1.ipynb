The folder ```images``` contains a gallery of 10 images. The folder ```images_200``` contains the same images but resized with the biggest dimension to not exceed 200 pixels. Initially, you will operate on the folder with the smaller images because the algorithms you will implement will be relatively slow, and will take a lot of time if made them to work on the images with original size. Also, you will convert the images to grayscale.\n","\n","Later in the exercise, you will implement a resizing function that will allow you to operate at the desired resolution, and you will also extend the algorithms to handle colors.\n","\n","The idea of image quantization is that the 256 levels used to represent each color channel or the intensity (if the image is grayscale), have to be mapped according to a uniform palette, obtained by setting the number of bits per color channel that you use. To encode the original 256 levels, 8 bits are necessary.
